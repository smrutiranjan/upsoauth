This is a custom oscommerce shipping module. it is on ups shipping rate calculation .
i have developed it for https://www.pispeakers.com/catalog site.
oauth process...
1) create token based upon ups client id, ups client secret id
2) then pass token on hearer for rate based upon the weight of product, shipper location
3) finally we display all service like ground,day time, save ,express at frontend to choose user desired ups shipping to checkout.
   Thanks
